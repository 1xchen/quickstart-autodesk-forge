# quickstart-autodesk-forge
## Autodesk Forge on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start sets up an Amazon Web Services (AWS) architecture and deploys Autodesk Forge on the AWS Cloud for customizable building blocks in the form of web service APIs, tools, and services. The deployment, which takes about 15 minutes, uses AWS best practices to address common scalability, high availability, and security requirements.

Autodesk Forge is a cloud developer platform for building custom software applications, workflows, and integrations across industries such as manufacturing, architecture, engineering, and construction. With Autodesk Forge, teams, third-party developers, and customers can design, build, and connect workflows. For example, developers can use Forge to overlay Internet of Things (IoT) data on top of 3D information models, to perform data analysis and create visual reports.  

The AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start automate the following:

- Deploying Autodesk Forge into a new virtual private cloud (VPC)
- Deploying Autodesk Forge into an existing VPC in your AWS account

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
